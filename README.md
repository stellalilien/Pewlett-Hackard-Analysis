# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many employees are eligible for retirement per job title and to also retrieve a list of employees eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This information will allow management to prepare for upcoming waves of retiring employees and how to transition into the future of their workforce.

## Results
The first step necessary was to create a table of retirement eligible employees and then eliminating duplicate entries so only current positions are included.

Using this table as a base another table was created showing the total counts for each job title, giving a concise overview of each position and it's potential workforce shift and in what areas they will need to begin recruitment.

Finally a new table is constructed of employees that will be eligible to participate in the mentorship program.

- The vast majority of retiring employees are currently employed in Senior Level positions.
- Senior engineers account for 33% of the eligible retirees
- Senior staff account for 31% of the eligible retirees
- Engineers account for 16% of the eligible retirees
- Staff account for 14% of the eligible retirees
- Technique Leaders account for 5% of the eligible retirees
- Assistant Engineers account for 2% of the eligible retirees
## Conclusion
90,398 employees are eligible for retirement, the majority being senior positions. While they are unlikely to all retire simultaneously, human resources will need to begin looking at recruitment options for the next generation. There are many qualified employees that will be able to assist using a mentorship program. Specifically focusing on the senior level employees and having them mentor those who are currently employed at a level beneath them in order to promote from within will help with the impending vacancies. If more internal candidates can be promoted in order to fill the positions that will become available then the human resources recruitment efforts should be focused on more of the entry level positions. Additional queries recommended would be determining the job title breakdowns for employees who are not yet eligible for retirement but may be eligible for internal promotion as well as data pertaining to the average length of time employees who have previously been promoted were in their more junior role prior to promotion. This information would provide additional context and illumnation on how many resources should be dedicated to internal mentorship vs external recruitment efforts.
